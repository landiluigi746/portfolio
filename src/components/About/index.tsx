          Hi, I'm Luigi Landi.
        </h1>
        <p className="font font-semibold">
          I'm an italian 13th grade computer science student and aspiring
          programmer with a passion for problem solving, learning, and building.
          I enjoy experimenting with different technologies and creating a wide
          variety of projectsâ€”both independently and as part of a team. Lately,
          my main interests revolve around game development, backend development
          and cybersecurity, especially software security, after reaching the
          finals of the 2025 edition of CyberChallenge.IT, which also brought my
          passion for CTF competitions. Here you can see my tech stack and top
          projects.
