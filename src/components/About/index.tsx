          I'm an italian 12th grade computer science student and aspiring
          programmer who always looks forward to challenges and learning new
          things. I like experimenting with different languages and building a
          large varitety of projects, both individually and in group. Currently,
          I am looking to improve my problem solving skills and start backend
          development. I'm also eager to explore the possibilities of AI and how
          it can be powerful. Looking forward to delving into these areas and
          expanding my skills. Here you can see my tech stack and top projects.
